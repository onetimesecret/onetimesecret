      <span class="font-bold dark:text-gray-300">Amendments.</span> We may from time to time modify the Terms of
      Use and will post a copy of the amended Terms of Use on the Website, so we encourage you to

    <h3 class="dark:text-gray-300">1. Resources Used for the Provision of Services</h3>
    <p class="prose dark:text-gray-300">
      User accounts have fixed limits in order that we can provide a well functioning service for
      all users. We can disable your account should there be any attempt to use the service in a way
      that we deem to be unreasonable and that affects the usage of the service by others. What
      consists of 'reasonable use' is completely at our discretion and your account may be disabled
      without prior notice if your usage is disruptive and if deemed necessary to restore a quality
      of service.
    </p>
    <h3 class="dark:text-gray-300">2. Protection of Privacy, User Data</h3>
    <p class="prose dark:text-gray-300">
      As spelled out in our
      <a class="font-bold dark:text-gray-300" href="/info/privacy" rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="Read more about our privacy policy">Privacy Policy</a>
      personal and account information will never be disclosed to third parties under any
      circumstances other than to respond to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal process, as
      required by law, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims.
      We will never sell or share any of this data.
    </p>
    <p class="prose dark:text-gray-300">
      Once a secret has been received by a recipient, we have no way of retrieving said secret
      again, nor do we log or keep any data that tracks the sender or receiver's IP address beyond
      14 days. Necessary data that attaches the contents of a secret to a user account is kept only
      until the secret is received, at which point it is destroyed permanently.
    </p>
    <h3 class="dark:text-gray-300">3. License, Restrictions and Prohibited Acts</h3>
    <p class="prose dark:text-gray-300">

      discretion, that a risk to the applicable service, to you or to any of our other users may be
      created if the Service were not suspended; or (c) in the event that we determine that any
      Service is prohibited by law or we otherwise determine that it is necessary or prudent to do
      so for legal or regulatory reasons (collectively, "Service Suspensions"). We shall have no
      liability whatsoever for any damage, liabilities, losses (including any loss of data or
      profits) or any other consequences that you may incur as a result of any Service Suspension.

      the Terms of Use, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers,
