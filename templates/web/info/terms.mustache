    <h3>1. Resources Used for the Provision of Services</h3>
    <p>
      For free tests (no registration or free accounts), our servers will generate a
      number of requests (currently 6) one time only.  For subscription-based tests,
      our servers will automatically generate a number of requests (currently 6)
      every few minutes (5mn or 10mn depending on the account). In order to run tests
      automatically at intervals, you will need to include a short authentication
      code on the site to be tested and nothing else. We will not use this
      authentication code for any purposes other than the performance of the Services
      (e.g., we do not collect any personal or statistical information from the
      website(s) being tested). You are solely responsible (i) to ensure that these
      website(s) can accommodate the requests from our servers, as the number of
      requests from our servers may increase the traffic to the website(s) that are
      tested and (ii)) to ensure that the authentication code that you may include in
      such website(s) does not interfere with the rest of the code of this(these)
      website(s).  
    </p>
    <h3>2. Types of Account</h3>

      Authorization for free accounts allows the user to run more tests against the
      site that the user confirms authorization for. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT
