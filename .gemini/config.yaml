# Default Gemini Code Assist review categories (when custom style guides aren't
# specified):
#
# - Correctness: Ensures code functions as intended, handles edge cases, checks
#   for logic errors, race conditions, or incorrect API usage.
# - Efficiency: Identifies performance bottlenecks like excessive loops, memory
#   leaks, inefficient data structures, redundant calculations, and string
#   manipulation.
# - Maintainability: Assesses readability, modularity, and best practices.
#   Targets poor naming, missing documentation, complexity, duplication,
#   inconsistent formatting, and magic numbers.
# - Security: Identifies vulnerabilities in data handling and input validation,
#   including insecure storage, injection attacks, insufficient access controls,
#   CSRF, and IDOR.
# - Miscellaneous: Testing, performance, scalability, modularity, reusability,
#   error logging, and monitoring.
