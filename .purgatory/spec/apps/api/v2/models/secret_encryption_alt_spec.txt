⏺ Excellent! This is exactly the problem we were trying to solve. The proper integration tests have revealed the real issue that was being hidden
  by the mocks:

  Summary

  What the rewritten tests accomplished:

  1. Exposed the real bug: The received! and burned! methods in the Secret model are calling md.received! and md.burned! on the metadata, but
  these calls are not actually updating the metadata state in Redis.
  2. Removed the mock dependency: Instead of mocking everything and testing that mocks work, we're now testing actual Redis persistence and
  discovering that the metadata state changes aren't being saved.
  3. Created proper integration tests: The tests now verify that:
    - Objects are properly saved to and loaded from Redis
    - State transitions actually persist
    - Business logic works end-to-end

  The original issue is now clearly visible:
  - When @secret.received! is called, it should update both the secret and metadata states
  - The secret gets destroyed (✅ working)
  - But the metadata state remains 'new' instead of changing to 'received' (❌ broken)
  - The metadata's secret_key is not cleared (❌ broken)

  This validates your observation about mocks hiding real issues. The heavily mocked tests were passing while the actual business logic was
  broken. The new integration tests immediately expose this problem.

  Next steps would be to fix the actual bug in the md.received! and md.burned! methods so they properly persist the metadata state changes to
  Redis. But now we have real tests that will verify the fix works correctly.

⏺ Update Todos
  ⎿  ☒ Analyze current test structure and identify over-mocking issues
     ☒ Rewrite secret_encryption_alt_spec.rb with minimal mocking and Redis integration
     ☒ Rewrite secret_encryption_spec.rb with minimal mocking and Redis integration
     ☒ Fix reload method issues in tests
     ☒ Focus on testing actual business logic and state persistence

⏺ The rewritten tests demonstrate exactly what you were getting at about mocks hiding real problems. The original heavily mocked tests were
  passing while the actual Redis persistence logic was broken. Now we have real integration tests that immediately expose the underlying business
  logic failures.

  This is a perfect example of why minimal mocking and integration testing is superior - it catches real bugs that unit tests with mocks
  completely miss.
