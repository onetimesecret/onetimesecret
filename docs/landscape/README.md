# Landscape Analysis

Documents in this directory map how open-source projects approach a given problem space. The unit of analysis is the ecosystem, not the individual project.

## Framing

These are cartographic documents. They describe terrain: what exists, where projects cluster, where gaps appear, and how the space is evolving. The projects surveyed are peers — potential collaborators, integration partners, and fellow travelers in open-source.

## Writing conventions

- State observations neutrally. Position projects on a landscape rather than ranking.
- Use "projects surveyed" or "other projects," not "competitors."
- Describe gaps as unoccupied space, not unclaimed territory.
- Frame ecosystem movement as trends, not threats.
- Preserve all factual detail. Neutral framing does not mean soft analysis.

## Structure

Each analysis document covers:

1. **Stack comparison** — tooling and infrastructure choices across projects
2. **Architecture comparison** — how each project solves the problem structurally
3. **Feature ratings** — capability matrix with explicit rating scale
4. **Positioning analysis** — how each project frames the feature commercially
5. **Strengths and gaps** — where OTS is ahead and where it has ground to cover
6. **Opportunities** — gaps no surveyed project fills
7. **Ecosystem trends** — investment patterns and directional shifts
8. **Strategic implications** — where to achieve parity vs. differentiate
