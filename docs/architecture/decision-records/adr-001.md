title: ADR-001: Naming and Separation of Rack Applications

## Context

One Time Secret is a monolith codebase using multiple Rack applications mounted via a registry pattern at different paths. The existing structure includes API apps (`apps/api/v1`, `apps/api/v2`), authentication (`auth`), and email validation (`truemail`).

The challenge was determining:
1. How to name the main frontend application directory without creating logical inconsistencies?
2. Whether to separate anonymous/public functionality from authenticated user functionality?
3. What naming convention to use that scales as new applications are added?

Key constraints:
- All applications are Rack-based web apps, so naming one "web" implies it's the only web component
- Core functionality (secret creation/retrieval) is available to both anonymous (non-authenticated) and authenticated users
- Anonymous traffic and authenticated traffic are similar but different in terms of user experience and security requirements
- Need to share Vue frontend components and backend code between apps

## Decision

**Naming Convention:**
- Use functional naming for all Rack applications, broadly split into api and web directories
- Name directories based on what the application does, not what it is; avoid generic terms like "web" or "frontend" that imply exclusivity

**Application Separation:**
- Separate anonymous/public functionality into a dedicated Rack app (`apps/public`)
- Separate authenticated user functionality into a dedicated Rack app (`apps/account`)
- Keep shared code in `lib/onetime` or `lib/shared` for shared models, services, utilities that is not specific to the project but not big enough to warrant its own repository.

**Directory Structure:**
```
apps/
├── public/        # Anonymous secret creation/retrieval
├── account/       # Authenticated user experience (dashboard, domains, settings)
├── auth/          # Authentication service
├── api/
│   └── v1/
│   └── v2/
lib/
├── onetime/       # Shared models, services, utilities
├── shared/        # Shared but not specific to the project
│
src/               # Vue application
```

**URL Path Structure:**
- Other than `public` the paths typically match the directory structure
- No generic containers like `/app`
- Optional shorthand for high-volume resources (e.g. `/s/[key]` for secrets)

## Consequences

### Positive
- Clear mental model: Directory boundaries reinforce conceptual boundaries between anonymous and authenticated functionality
- Reduced blast radius: Changes to account management can't break core secret creation flow
- Independent optimization: Can tune performance/caching separately for each use case
- Logical consistency: All apps named by function, no implied hierarchy
- Scalability: Naming pattern works as additional apps are added

### Negative
- Additional coordination: Sharing code between apps requires more disciplined dependency management
- Organizational complexity: More directories and mount points to understand
- Potential duplication: Risk of reimplementing similar features if shared code isn't leveraged properly
- Deployment coordination: Changes to shared libraries affect multiple apps

### Neutral
- Requires explicit code sharing strategy (already addressed via `lib/shared` and `lib/frontend`)
- Need to maintain clear boundaries about which functionality belongs in which app
- Router configuration becomes more explicit about mount paths and responsibilities
