# LLM-Optimized Test Cases: Account Creation
# Schema version: 1.0.0

suite:
  id: account-creation
  name: Account Creation and Signup Flow
  feature: User registration via SignUpForm component
  tags: [auth, signup, registration, forms, validation]
  priority: critical
  notes: |
    Tests cover the signup form at /signup. Successful signup redirects to /signin
    with a success notification. The form requires email, password, and terms
    agreement. Backend validation handles duplicate emails and password strength.
