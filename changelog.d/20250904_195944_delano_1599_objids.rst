<!-- SafeDump DSL migration for Familia v2.0.0-pre12 upgrade -->

Changed
=======

- Updated all models to use the new SafeDump DSL, replacing the brittle ``@safe_dump_fields`` class instance variable pattern with clean, explicit ``safe_dump_field`` method calls. This improves code maintainability and follows the modern Familia v2.0 patterns.

AI Assistance
=============

- Systematic migration of 10 model files (both V1 and V2 APIs) from legacy ``@safe_dump_fields`` array syntax to the new DSL. AI assistance included code analysis, pattern identification, and bulk refactoring while preserving all existing functionality and field definitions.
