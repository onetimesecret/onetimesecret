.. A new scriv changelog fragment.

Changed
-------

- Publisher now supports configurable fallback strategies when RabbitMQ is
  unavailable: ``:async_thread`` (default, non-blocking), ``:sync`` (blocking),
  ``:raise`` (error), or ``:none`` (silent fail). This replaces the previous
  3-second retry delay that could block Puma threads during outages. PR #2064

- Critical auth flows (password reset, Rodauth emails) use ``:sync`` fallback
  to ensure delivery; non-critical paths (feedback) use ``:none`` to avoid
  thread proliferation.

AI Assistance
-------------

- RabbitMQ architecture review identified sync fallback as blocking issue.
  Claude assisted with designing the opt-in fallback parameter API and
  Thread.new implementation for Puma compatibility.
