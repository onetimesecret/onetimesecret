.. A new scriv changelog fragment.

Changed
-------

- DLQ message TTL is now managed via a RabbitMQ policy (``dlq-ttl``) rather
  than queue arguments. Policies are mutable at runtime; queue arguments are
  not, and caused ``PRECONDITION_FAILED`` errors on worker startup when TTL
  config changed. PR #2529

- ``bin/ots queue init`` now applies the ``dlq-ttl`` policy as step 4 via the
  Management API. ``bin/ots queue status`` reports active DLQ policies.

**Upgrading existing installs** (environments with DLQ queues declared before
this release):

.. code-block:: bash

   # Check DLQ message counts — any messages are failed jobs already dead-lettered
   bin/ots queue status

   # Stop workers, then delete and recreate all queues (destroys DLQ messages)
   bin/ots queue reset --force

   # Recreate infrastructure and apply the dlq-ttl policy
   bin/ots queue init

   # Restart workers and verify
   bin/ots queue status

If DLQ messages must be preserved, drain them before resetting (requeue or
archive via the Management UI), then proceed with the reset.

AI Assistance
-------------

- Claude assisted with debugging CI test failures in the DLQ policy filter
  and nil/empty-array return value semantics for the Management API client.
