Changed
-------

- Refactored API v2 authentication strategies to use Otto 1.5+ class-based architecture instead of lambda functions. This improves maintainability, error handling, and type safety while providing better structured authentication results. Issue #1619

- Updated API v2 logic layer to use Otto RequestContext for consistent request state management across the application. This provides better encapsulation of session, user, auth method, and request metadata. Issue #1619

AI Assistance
-------------

- Significant assistance with refactoring authentication strategy architecture from lambda-based to class-based implementations, ensuring proper inheritance from Otto::Security::AuthStrategy and consistent error handling patterns.
