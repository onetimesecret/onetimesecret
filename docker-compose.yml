# ONETIME - DOCKER COMPOSE CONFIG - 2024-04-10
#
# Usage:
#
#     $ docker-compose up -d redis
#     $ docker-compose up --build onetime
#
#         - or simply -
#
#     $ docker-compose up
#
#
# Initial setup:
#
# Before running any docker-compose commands, copy the example
# configuration files into place on the host machine (the system
# that's running the docker daemon):
#
#     $ cp --preserve --no-clobber ./etc/config.example ./etc/config
#     $ cp --preserve --no-clobber .env.example .env
#
# Modify each file as needed. They're both mounted inside the
# onetime-app container so any changes you make "locally" on
# the host are reflected inside the container immediately
# without having to re-build.
#
