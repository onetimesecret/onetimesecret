        We can't show it to you because we don't know what it is. When you create a secret with a
        passphrase, we immediately hash it with
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt" class="text-brand-500 hover:underline"
          >bcrypt</a
        >. Since we don't store the passphrase, we have no way to show it to you. That also means when
        you include a passphrase, we have no way to decrypt your secret.
      </p>

      <h4 class="font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Why can't I see the secret value?</h4>
      <p class="mb-4">
        We display the value for you so that you can verify it but we do that once so that if someone
        gets this private page (in your browser history or if you accidentally send the private link
        instead of the secret one), they won't see the secret value.
      </p>

    <h4 class="font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">What happens when I burn a secret?</h4>
    <p class="mb-4">
      Burning a secret will delete it before it has been read. If you send someone a secret link and
      burn the secret before they view it, they will not be able to read it. In fact, it will look
      to them like the secret never existed at all.
    </p>

    <h4 class="font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Why can I only see the secret value once?</h4>
    <p class="mb-4">
      We display the value for you so that you can verify it but we do that once so that if someone
      gets this private page (in your browser history or if you accidentally send the private link

    <h4 class="font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">How long will the secret be available?</h4>
