If you use a Onetime link instead, the information persists for a single viewing which means it can't be read by someone else later. This allows you to send sensitive information in a safe way knowing it's seen by one person only. Think of it like a self-destructing message.",

      "file_limitation_title": "Why can't I send pictures or other kinds of files?",
      "file_limitation_description": "Our service is designed specifically for text-based secrets to ensure maximum security and simplicity. Files, especially images, can contain metadata that might unintentionally reveal information about the sender or recipient. By focusing on text, we can guarantee that no additional data is transmitted beyond what you explicitly type. If you need to share a file securely, we recommend using a dedicated secure file transfer service. We may consider adding support for files in the future if there are compelling use cases for it.",

      "text_copy_title": "But I can copy the secret text. What's the difference?",

      "secret_retrieval_description": "Nope. We display it once and then delete it. After that, it's gone forever.",

      "account_difference_description": "Anonymous users can create secrets that last up to {anonymousTtlDays} days and have a maximum size of {anonymousSizeKB} KB. Free account holders get extended benefits: secrets can last up to {defaultTtlDays} days and can be up to {defaultSizeKB} KB in size. Account holders also get access to additional features like burn-before-reading options, which allow senders to delete secrets before they're received.",

      "law_enforcement_title": "How do you handle data requests from law enforcement or other third parties?",
      "law_enforcement_description": "We designed our system with privacy in mind. We don't store secrets after they've been viewed, and we don't keep access logs beyond the minimum necessary. This means that in most cases, we simply don't have any data to provide in response to such requests. For more details, please review our {privacyPolicyLink}.",

      "passphrase_description": "When you use a passphrase, we encrypt your secret on our servers using the passphrase you provide. We don't store the passphrase itself, only a bcrypt hash of it. This hash is used to verify the passphrase when the recipient enters it. Here's why this is secure:",
