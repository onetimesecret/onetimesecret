      "file_limitation_description": "Our service is designed specifically for text-based secrets to ensure maximum security and simplicity. Files, especially images, can contain metadata that might unintentionally reveal information about the sender or recipient. By focusing on text, we can guarantee that no additional data is transmitted beyond what you explicitly type. If you need to share a file securely, we recommend using a dedicated secure file transfer service. We may consider adding support for files in the future if there are compelling use cases for it.",

      "account_difference_description": "Anonymous users can create secrets that last up to {anonymousTtlDays} days and have a maximum size of {anonymousSizeKB} KB. Free account holders get extended benefits: secrets can last up to {defaultTtlDays} days and can be up to {defaultSizeKB} KB in size. Account holders also get access to additional features like burn-before-reading options, which allow senders to delete secrets before they're received.",

      "law_enforcement_description": "We designed our system with privacy in mind. We don't store secrets after they've been viewed, and we don't keep access logs beyond the minimum necessary. This means that in most cases, we simply don't have any data to provide in response to such requests. For more details, please review our {privacyPolicyLink}.",
