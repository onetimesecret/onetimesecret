## Potentially Misplaced Keys

**None identified.** All keys are cohesive and appropriately placed within the `feature-testimonials.json` file. The file serves a single, well-defined feature (AI-generated testimonials).

## Suggested Hierarchy Improvements

### Issue 1: Flat Structure

The current structure places all keys at the same level under `web.testimonials`. A hierarchical grouping would improve organization:

```json
{
  "web": {
    "testimonials": {
      "labels": {
        "ai-generated": "AI-Generated Testimonial",
        "artificial-feedback": "Artificial Feedback"
      },
      "headers": {
        "what-ai-says": "What leading AI says about us",
        "ai-generated": "AI-Generated Testimonials"
      },
      "disclaimers": {
        "short": "AI-generated content for demonstration. Not from an actual person or company.",
        "full": "This content is AI-generated based on the content of this page and does not represent an actual person or company.",
        "source-prefix": "This quote was generated by",
        "source-suffix": "It was based on the content of the page and does not represent an actual person or company."
      },
      "templates": {
        "rating": "{0}/5",
        "attribution": "- {0}, {1}",
        "quote": "\"{0}\""
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Issue 2: Truncated Key Names

Several keys appear to be auto-generated or truncated:
- `this-quote-was-generated-by` - truncated mid-sentence
- `it-was-based-on-the-content-of-the-page-and-does` - truncated mid-sentence
- `this-content-is-ai-generated-based-on-the-conten` - truncated mid-word

**Recommendation:** Use semantic key names that describe the purpose, not the content:
- `disclaimer-source-prefix`
- `disclaimer-source-suffix`
- `disclaimer-full`

### Issue 3: Redundant Keys

Two keys serve similar purposes:
- `ai-generated-content-disclaimer` and `this-content-is-ai-generated-based-on-the-conten...`

**Recommendation:** Consolidate into a single `disclaimers.full` key or differentiate their use cases clearly (e.g., `disclaimers.tooltip` vs `disclaimers.inline`).

### Issue 4: Template Key Naming

Keys like `randomtestimonial-stars-5` embed component-specific prefixes that reduce reusability.

**Recommendation:** Use generic template names:
- `templates.rating` instead of `randomtestimonial-stars-5`
- `templates.attribution` instead of `randomtestimonial-name-randomtestimonial-company`
- `templates.quote` instead of `randomtestimonial-quote`

## New File Suggestions

**None required.** The file is appropriately scoped. AI-generated testimonials are a distinct feature that warrants its own file. The key count is reasonable (10 keys) and all keys are thematically related.

## Relationship to Other Files

| Related File | Relationship |
|--------------|--------------|
| `feature-feedback.json` | Both deal with user/public-facing feedback, but serve different purposes (testimonials = display, feedback = collection) |
| `_common.json` | No overlap; testimonial keys are feature-specific |
| `homepage.json` | If testimonials are displayed on homepage, keys should remain here but be referenced from homepage components |

## Summary

The `feature-testimonials.json` file is well-scoped with no misplaced keys. The primary improvements needed are:

1. **Add hierarchy** - Group keys into `labels`, `headers`, `disclaimers`, and `templates` subcategories
2. **Fix truncated key names** - Replace auto-generated names with semantic identifiers
3. **Consolidate redundancy** - Merge duplicate disclaimer variations
4. **Generalize template keys** - Remove component-specific prefixes from template key names

These changes would improve maintainability and make the keys more discoverable for translators.
