        If you&#39;re <span class="font-bold dark:text-gray-300">just browsing the website</span>, we collect the same basic
        information that most websites collect. We use common internet technologies, such as cookies

        The information we collect about all visitors to our website includes the visitor’s browser
        type, language preference, referring site, additional websites requested, and the date and

        this may include &quot;User Personal Information.&quot;
      </p>
      <p class="prose dark:text-gray-300">
        &quot;User Personal Information&quot; is any information about one of our users which could,

      </p>
      <p class="prose dark:text-gray-300">
        We do not host advertising on onetimesecret.com. We may occasionally embed content from third

        services.
      </p>

        We may share User Personal Information if we are involved in a merger, sale, or acquisition.
        If any such change of ownership happens, we will ensure that it is under terms that preserve
        the confidentiality of User Personal Information, and we will notify you on our website or by
        email before any transfer of your User Personal Information. The organization receiving any
        User Personal Information will have to honor any promises we have made in our Privacy
        Statement or in our Terms of Service.

        share this kind of data with third party services or permit this kind of third party data

        appointed a Privacy Counsel and we work hard to comply with the applicable data privacy laws
        wherever we do business. Additionally, we require that if our vendors or affiliates have
        access to User Personal Information, they must comply with our privacy policies and with
        applicable data privacy laws, including signing data transfer agreements such as Standard
        Contractual Clause agreements.

        notice, choice, accountability, security, and access, and we limit the purpose for processing.
        We also provide our users a method of recourse and enforcement. These are the Privacy Shield
