      <h3 class="dark:text-gray-300">1. Resources Used for the Provision of Services</h3>
      <p class="prose dark:text-gray-300">
        User accounts have fixed limits in order that we can provide a well functioning service for
        all users. We can disable your account should there be any attempt to use the service in a way
        that we deem to be unreasonable and that affects the usage of the service by others. What
        consists of 'reasonable use' is completely at our discretion and your account may be disabled
        without prior notice if your usage is disruptive and if deemed necessary to restore a quality
        of service.
      </p>
      <h3 class="dark:text-gray-300">2. Protection of Privacy, User Data</h3>
      <p class="prose dark:text-gray-300">
        As spelled out in our
        <a class="font-bold dark:text-gray-300" href="/info/privacy" rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="Read more about our privacy policy">Privacy Policy</a>
        personal and account information will never be disclosed to third parties under any
        circumstances other than to respond to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal process, as
        required by law, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims.
        We will never sell or share any of this data.
      </p>
      <p class="prose dark:text-gray-300">
        Once a secret has been received by a recipient, we have no way of retrieving said secret
        again, nor do we log or keep any data that tracks the sender or receiver's IP address beyond
        14 days. Necessary data that attaches the contents of a secret to a user account is kept only
        until the secret is received, at which point it is destroyed permanently.
      </p>
      <h3 class="dark:text-gray-300">3. License, Restrictions and Prohibited Acts</h3>
      <p class="prose dark:text-gray-300">
        <span class="font-bold dark:text-gray-300">Grant of License.</span> Onetime Secret grants you a limited, nonexclusive,

        <span class="font-bold dark:text-gray-300">Interruptions.</span> You acknowledge that: (i) your access to and use of the
        Website and/or the provision Services may be suspended for the duration of any unanticipated

        shall also be entitled, without any liability to you, to suspend access to any portion or all
        of the Website and/or the Services at any time (a) for scheduled downtime to permit us to

        service attack or other attack on the Website or other event that we determine, in our sole
        discretion, that a risk to the applicable service, to you or to any of our other users may be
        created if the Service were not suspended; or (c) in the event that we determine that any
        Service is prohibited by law or we otherwise determine that it is necessary or prudent to do
        so for legal or regulatory reasons (collectively, "Service Suspensions"). We shall have no
        liability whatsoever for any damage, liabilities, losses (including any loss of data or
        profits) or any other consequences that you may incur as a result of any Service Suspension.

      <p class="prose dark:text-gray-300">
        <span class="font-bold dark:text-gray-300">Watch of Interruptions.</span> To the extent we are able, we will endeavour to post
        updates on the Website regarding any Service Suspension and resumption of service following

        fail to do so.
      </p>
      <h3 class="dark:text-gray-300">5. Security</h3>

        <a class="font-bold dark:text-gray-300" href="/info/security" rel="noopener noreferrer">reasonable security measures</a> to protect against unauthorized
        access to your account. We cannot, however, guarantee absolute security of your account or the
        personal information we collect, and we cannot promise that our security measures will prevent
        thirdparty "hackers" from illegally accessing the Website or its contents. You agree to
        immediately notify Onetime Secret of any unauthorized use or your account, or any other breach
        of security, and you accept all risks of unauthorized access to the Website, your Account

        <span class="font-bold dark:text-gray-300">Surviving Obligations.</span> All provisions of the Terms of Use which by their
        nature should survive expiration or termination shall survive the expiration or termination of
        the Terms of Use, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers,
        and limitations of liability. Termination of your access to and use of the Website shall not
        relieve you of any obligations arising or accruing prior to such expiration or termination or
        limit any liability which you otherwise may have to Onetime Secret, including without
        limitation any indemnification obligations contained herein.
