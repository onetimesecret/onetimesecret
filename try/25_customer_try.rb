# These tryouts test the customer model functionality in the OneTime application.
# They cover various aspects of customer management, including:
#
# 1. Customer creation and initialization
# 2. Customer attributes (planid, custid, role, etc.)
# 3. Customer states (pending, verified, active)
# 4. Timestamp handling (created, updated, last_login)
# 5. Customer destruction process
#
# These tests aim to verify the correct behavior of the OT::Customer class,
# which is essential for managing user accounts in the application.
#
# The tryouts simulate different customer scenarios and test the OT::Customer class's
# behavior without needing to run the full application, allowing for targeted testing
# of these specific scenarios.
