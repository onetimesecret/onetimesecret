# RE: private networking between machines
#
# @see https://fly.io/docs/networking/private-networking/#
#
# Applications within the same organization are assigned special addresses
# (6PN addresses) tied to the organization. Those applications can talk to
# each other because of those 6PN addresses, but applications from other
# organizations can't; the Fly.io platform won't forward between different
# 6PN networks.
#
# This connectivity is always available to apps; you don't have to do
# anything special to get it.
#
# You can connect apps running outside of Fly.io to your 6PN network
# using WireGuard; for that matter, you can connect your dev laptop to
# your 6PN network. To do that, you'll use flyctl, the Fly.io CLI, to
# generate a WireGuard configuration that has a 6PN address.

# RE: volumes and mounts
# @see https://fly.io/docs/reference/volumes/
#
# To prevent a single server hardware failure from taking down multiple Fly Machines, it is better if each volume you create for your app is placed in a separate hardware zone (i.e. on a different server). This happens by default when using fly volumes create, but is not guaranteed when creating Fly Volumes through other methods.

##
# RE: secrets
# @see https://fly.io/docs/reference/secrets/#setting-secrets
#
# To set, or update, a secret in the app’s vault, but defer updating the Machines to later, use the --stage option. For example:
#
#   fly secrets set DATABASE_URL=postgres://example.com/mydb --stage
