# Otto Routes - Team API (Site-Only Endpoints)
# Using direct Logic class routing with authentication strategies
#
# Team API handles team and member management endpoints.
# These endpoints are not part of the public API and don't need versioning.
# All endpoints require authentication (session or basic).
