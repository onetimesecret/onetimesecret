# Otto Routes - Organization API (Site-Only Endpoints)
# Using direct Logic class routing with authentication strategies
#
# Organization API handles organization management endpoints.
# These endpoints are not part of the public API and don't need versioning.
# All endpoints require authentication (session or basic).

# Organization Management
# Uses extid (external ID) in URLs for security; orgid (internal ID) is for internal use only
