# ONETIME - DOCKER IMAGE - 2024-04-10
#
#
# To build and use this image, you need to copy the example
# configuration files into place:
#
#     $ cp --preserve --no-clobber ./etc/config.example ./etc/config
#
#           - and -
#
#     $ cp --preserve --no-clobber .env.example .env
#
# The default values work as-is but it's a good practice to have
# a look and customize as you like (partcularly the mast secret
# `SECRET` and redis password in `REDIS_URL`).
#
#
# USAGE (Docker):
#
# First, start a Redis database with persistence enabled:
#
#     $ docker run -p 6379:6379 --name redis -d redis
#
# Then build and run this image, specifying the redis URL:
#
#     $ docker run -p 3000:3000 -d --name onetimesecret \
#       -e REDIS_URL="redis://172.17.0.2:6379/0" \
#       onetimesecret
#
# It will be accessible on http://localhost:3000.
#
#
# USAGE (Docker Compose):
#
# When bringing up a frontend container for the first time, makes
# sure the database container is already running and attached.
#
#     $ docker-compose up -d redis
#     $ docker-compose up --attach-dependencies --build onetime
#
# If you ever need to force rebuild a container:
#
#     $ docker-compose build --no-cache onetime
#
#
# Production deployment
# ---------------------
#
# When deploying to production, you should protect your Redis instance with
# authentication or Redis networks. You should also enable persistence and
# save the data somewhere, to make sure it doesn't get lost when the
# server restarts.
#
# You should also change the secret to something else, and specify the
# domain it will be deployed on. For instance, if OTS will be accessible
# from https://example.com:
#
#   $ docker run -p 3000:3000 -d \
#     -e REDIS_URL="redis://user:password@host:port/0" \
#     -e SSL=true -e HOST=example.com \
#     -e SECRET="<put your own secret here>" \
#     onetimesecret

# About the interplay between the Dockerfile CMD instruction
# and the Docker Compose command setting:
#
# 1. The CMD instruction in the Dockerfile sets the default command to
# be executed when the container is started.
#
# 2. The command setting in the Docker Compose configuration overrides
# the CMD instruction in the Dockerfile.
#
# 3. Using the CMD instruction in the Dockerfile provides a fallback
# command, which can be useful if no specific command is set in the
# Docker Compose configuration.
