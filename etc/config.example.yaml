# CONFIGURATION OVERVIEW
# ======================
# This configuration file has been updated to use a new static configuration approach.
# Previously, this file contained the entire configuration object with all possible
# settings and their default values. Now it follows a more streamlined approach.
#
# HOW IT WORKS
# ============
# This file should only contain explicit overrides to the default configuration.
# The full default configuration is generated by the application based on the JSON schema.
#
# USAGE GUIDELINES
# ================
# - Only add settings that you want to change from their defaults
# - Remove or comment out any settings you want to keep at default values
# - The application will automatically merge your overrides with generated defaults
#
# SECTION BEHAVIOR
# ================
# If a top-level section (e.g., 'site', 'mail') is completely absent from this file,
# all its values will be taken from the generated defaults.
# If a top-level section is present (e.g., 'site:' is uncommented), only the
# properties specified under it here will override the defaults for that section.
# Other properties within that section will still come from the generated defaults.

# Example: Override a specific logging setting
logging:
  http_requests: false

# Example: Override a specific site secret and add a colonel
# site:
#   secret: "a_custom_user_defined_secret_here"
#   authentication:
#     colonels:
#       - "colonel@example.com"

# Example: Override a mail setting
# mail:
#   connection:
#     host: "smtp.custom.example.com"
