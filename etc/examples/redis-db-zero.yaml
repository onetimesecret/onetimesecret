    # Database mapping configuration for Redis
    #
    # Onetime Secret uses multiple Redis databases to organize different types of data.
    # This is an uncommon pattern - most applications simply use database 0 for everything.
    # If you're just getting started or have a simpler setup, you can safely keep all
    # mappings set to 0 (the default Redis database). This won't affect functionality
    # and will keep your data management straightforward.
    #
    # Note that most Redis-as-a-Service providers (like Redis Cloud, Upstash Redis,
    # Heroku Redis, etc) only support database 0, so you can use this configuration
    # in production environments without any modifications (other than possible the
    # REDIS_URL).
