name: Ruby CI

# This GitHub Actions workflow is named "Ruby CI" and is
# triggered by push events on branches starting with "fix/" or
# "rel/", pull requests on the
#
# The workflow has a single job named "build" that runs on the
# latest version of Ubuntu. It uses a strategy matrix to run
# the job with different
#
# The steps in the job are as follows:
# 1. Checkout code using the actions/checkout@v4 action.
# 2. Set up the specified version of Ruby using the
#     ruby/setup-ruby@v1 action.
# 3. Install dependencies using Bundler. The Bundler version
#     is determined by the matrix variable.
# 4. Run the "try" command using bundle exec try. The
#     continue-on-error flag is set to true, allowing the
#     workflow to continue even if this step
#
# This workflow is designed for continuous integration of a
# Ruby project, ensuring that the code builds and dependencies
# are installed correctly.
