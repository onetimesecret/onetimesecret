# .github/workflows/ci.yml

name: CI

# Main CI workflow that runs Ruby tests using RSpec and tryouts, plus TypeScript
# tests using Vitest and validation steps (linting, type-checking).
#
# The workflow is triggered by push events on branches starting with "fix/" or
# "rel/", pull requests on main/develop/feature/* branches, and manual dispatch.
#
# The workflow has jobs for:
# - Ruby testing (RSpec and tryouts) across multiple Ruby versions
# - TypeScript testing (Vitest) and validation (linting, type-checking)
#
# This workflow ensures comprehensive testing across the full stack.

    # Can also be set to `self-hosted` if worker is running. Possible
    # issue when switching (or trying to run a mix of github-hosted
    # and self-hosted). All workflows in the repo stopped being queued
    # up after having a self-hosted worker registered and available
    # and then manually shutdown and removed. To the extent that open
    # PRs showed 0 checks at all (as though there were no workflow
    # yaml files at all). Adding a new workflow in a test branch
    # seemed to wake up the dragon and all was well in the world.
