---
# Onetime Secret Ops
#
# This workflow locks closed issues and PRs after a period of inactivity to
# prevent necroposting and keep discussions focused on active work.
#
# Documentation:
# https://github.com/dessant/lock-threads
#
# ## Workflow Guidance
#
# - Use existing tags, don't create new tags, but suggestions always welcome.
# - Keep any Issue or PR templates minimal.
# - Use separate github workflows for triggers that are not copacetic: for
#   example, something that runs when an issue created shouldn't run when a
#   PR is created as well; or workflows that are meant to run on different
#   schedules.
