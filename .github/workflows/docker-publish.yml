# Docker image tagging strategy:
#
# Release tags (v1.0.0):        {version}, latest
# Release candidates (v1.0.0-rc1): {version}, next
# Branches (feature/x):         {branch-name}
#
# This ensures stable releases are tagged as 'latest' while release candidates
# are tagged as 'next' for early testing. Branch builds get descriptive tags.
