# .github/workflows/vue-tests.yml

name: Vue Tests

# This GitHub Action runs Vue.js tests using Vitest
#
#  1. It triggers on pushes to fix/* and rel/* branches, pull requests to
#     main/develop/feature/* branches, and manual workflow dispatch.
#  2. It uses Ubuntu as the runner environment.
#  3. It checks out your code and sets up Node.js version 22.
#  4. It installs pnpm version 10, as specified in your `package.json`.
#  5. It installs the project dependencies using `pnpm install`.
#  6. It runs the tests using the `pnpm test` command, which corresponds to
#     the `"test": "vitest run --printConsoleTrace"` script in your `package.json`.
#
#  This action ensures that your Vue tests are run on every push to relevant
#  branches and for every pull request.
#
#  Note that this action uses Vitest for running tests, as specified in
#  your `package.json`. If you need to add any specific Vite or Vue
#  configuration for testing, you can do so in your `vite.config.ts` file.
#
#  For more information on GitHub Actions, you can refer to the [official
#  documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions).
