# Onetime Secret Ops
#
# This workflow notifies and closes issues and PRs that have had no activity
# for a specified amount of time.
#
# Documentation:
# https://github.com/actions/stale
#
# ## Workflow Guidance
#
# - Use existing tags, don't create new tags, but suggestions always welcome.
# - Keep any Issue or PR templates minimal.
# - Use separate github workflows for triggers that are not copacetic: for
#   example, something that runs when an issue created shouldn't run when a
#   PR is created as well; or workflows that are meant to run on different
#   schedules.
#
# ## Future Considerations
#
# - Consider adding a `needs-triage` label and auto-labeling workflow to
#   automatically tag new issues for review. This helps ensure nothing falls
#   through the cracks and provides visibility into the inbound issue queue.
