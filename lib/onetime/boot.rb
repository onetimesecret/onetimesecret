    # Boot reads and interprets the configuration and applies it to the
    # relevant features and services. Must be called after applications
    # are loaded so that models have been required which is a pre-req
    # for attempting the database connection. Prior to that, Familia.members
    # is empty so we don't have any central list of models to work off
    # of.

    # `mode` is a symbol, one of: :app, :cli, :test. It's used for logging
    # but otherwise doesn't do anything special (other than allow :cli to
    # continue even when it's cloudy with a chance of boot errors).
    #
    # When `db` is false, the database connections won't be initialized. This
    # is useful for testing or when you want to run code without necessary
    # loading all or any of the models.

    # a database connection. It can't connect models it doesn't know about.

      # though there were 30+ testcases defined in the file. There
      # were no log messages to indicate where the problem occurred
      # possibly because:
      #
      # 1. RSpec captures each example's STDOUT/STDERR and only prints it
      #    once the example finishes.
      # 2. Calling `exit` in the middle of an example kills the process
      #    immediatelyâ€”any pending output (your `OT.le` message, buffered
      #    IO, etc.) never gets flushed back through RSpec's reporter.
      #
      # We were fortunate to find the issue via rspec. We had mocked
      # the connect_database method but also called the original:
      #
      # allow(Onetime).to receive(:connect_databases).and_call_original

      # we continue with reduced functionality.
