      # though there were 30+ testcases defined in the file. There
      # were no log messages to indicate where the problem occurred
      # possibly because:
      #
      # 1. RSpec captures each example's STDOUT/STDERR and only prints it
      #    once the example finishes.
      # 2. Calling `exit` in the middle of an example kills the process
      #    immediatelyâ€”any pending output (your `OT.le` message, buffered
      #    IO, etc.) never gets flushed back through RSpec's reporter.
      #
      # We were fortunate to find the issue via rspec. We had mocked
      # the connect_database method but also called the original:
