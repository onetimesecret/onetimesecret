    # Returns the current wall clock time as microseconds since Unix epoch
    # using the system's high-precision clock interface. This method provides
    # the most accurate and consistent timestamp available on the platform.
    #
    # Uses Process.clock_gettime with CLOCK_REALTIME, which directly
    # interfaces with the system's realtime clock and typically offers better
    # precision and performance than Time-based alternatives. The
    # CLOCK_REALTIME source represents actual wall clock time and is suitable
    # for timestamps that need to be compared across system restarts or with
    # external systems.
    #
    # @return [Integer] Microseconds since Unix epoch (January 1, 1970
    #   00:00:00 UTC)
    #   Range: ~1,600,000,000,000,000 to ~4,100,000,000,000,000 (current
    #   era to ~2100 CE)
    #   Precision: 1 microsecond (1/1,000,000 second)
    #
    # @note This method is optimal for:
    #   - Redis sorted set scores (avoids floating-point precision issues)
    #   - High-frequency timestamp generation in tests
    #   - Performance-critical timestamp operations
    #   - Cross-platform consistent precision
    #
    # @note Platform considerations:
    #   - Linux: True microsecond or nanosecond precision typically available
    #   - macOS: Usually microsecond precision, nanosecond may be simulated
    #   - Windows: Precision varies, typically millisecond to microsecond
    #
    # @example
    #   hnowµs  #=> 1716825600123456
    #   hnowµs  #=> 1716825600123457 (called 1 microsecond later)
    #
    # @see Process.clock_gettime Ruby documentation for underlying
    #   implementation

    # Returns the current UTC time as microseconds since Unix epoch, computed
    # from Ruby's Time object. This method converts the high-precision
    # floating-point time representation to an integer microsecond count.
    #
    # Uses Familia.now.utc.to_f which returns seconds as a Float with subsecond
    # precision, then multiplies by 1,000,000 and converts to integer. While
    # generally reliable, this approach may have slight performance overhead
    # compared to direct system clock access and could theoretically suffer
    # from floating-point precision limitations with very large timestamp
    # values (though not practically relevant until ~2285 CE).
    #
    # @return [Integer] Microseconds since Unix epoch (January 1, 1970
    #   00:00:00 UTC)
    #   Range: Same as hnowµs but computed via different path
    #   Precision: Limited by Familia.now precision and floating-point
    #   conversion
    #
    # @note This method is suitable for:
    #   - General-purpose timestamping where maximum precision isn't critical
    #   - Legacy code compatibility where Familia.now patterns are established
    #   - Situations where Process.clock_gettime isn't available (very old
    #     Ruby versions)
    #
    # @note Considerations:
    #   - Slightly slower than hnowµs due to floating-point arithmetic
    #   - Precision depends on Familia.now implementation (usually microsecond
    #     or better)
    #   - Result should be identical to hnowµs under normal circumstances
    #   - May show small variations from hnowµs due to different code paths
    #
    # @example
    #   nowµs  #=> 1716825600123456
    #   nowµs  #=> 1716825600123458 (called shortly after)

    # Returns the current time as a Time object in UTC timezone. This is the
    # standard Ruby approach for obtaining timezone-normalized time objects
    # suitable for date/time arithmetic, formatting, and general temporal
    # operations.
    #
    # The returned Time object contains full precision available from the
    # system (typically microsecond, potentially nanosecond) and provides
    # rich functionality for time manipulation, comparison, and formatting
    # operations.
    #
    # @return [Time] Time object representing current UTC time
    #   Precision: Full system precision (accessible via #nsec, #usec methods)
    #   Timezone: Always UTC (Coordinated Universal Time)
    #
    # @note This method is optimal for:
    #   - Human-readable time formatting and display
    #   - Date/time arithmetic operations (adding days, months, etc.)
    #   - Time zone conversions and calculations
    #   - Integration with Rails/ActiveSupport time helpers
    #   - Situations requiring Time object methods (#strftime, #year, #month, etc.)
    #
    # @note Avoid for:
    #   - Redis sorted set scores (use hnowµs or nowµs instead)
    #   - Numeric timestamp comparisons (conversion overhead)
    #   - High-frequency operations where integer timestamps suffice
    #
    # @example
    #   now  #=> 2024-05-27 14:26:40.123456 UTC
    #   now.to_i  #=> 1716825600 (seconds since epoch)
    #   now.usec  #=> 123456 (microsecond component)

    # Returns the current wall clock time as a floating-point number of
    # seconds since the Unix epoch, using the system's high-precision clock
    # interface.
    #
    # This method utilizes Process.clock_gettime with CLOCK_REALTIME and
    # :float_second, providing sub-second precision suitable for performance
    # measurements, time calculations, and scenarios where fractional seconds
    # are required.
    #
    # @return [Float] Seconds since Unix epoch (January 1, 1970 00:00:00
    #   UTC), with sub-second precision
    #
    # @note This method is optimal for:
    #   - High-precision time interval calculations
    #   - Profiling and benchmarking code execution
    #   - Scenarios requiring floating-point timestamps
    #
    # @note Platform considerations:
    #   - Precision and accuracy depend on the underlying operating system
    #     and hardware
    #   - Typically provides microsecond or better precision on modern
    #     systems
    #
    # @example
    #   hnow  #=> 1716825600.123456
    #   hnow  #=> 1716825600.123457 (called microseconds later)

    # Returns the current monotonic time in microseconds for duration
    # measurements. Uses CLOCK_MONOTONIC which is immune to system clock
    # adjustments (NTP, DST, manual changes) making it ideal for measuring
    # elapsed time intervals.
    #
    # Delegates to Familia.now_in_μs which uses Process.clock_gettime with
    # CLOCK_MONOTONIC. This clock always moves forward at a constant rate
    # and is perfect for performance measurements, timeouts, and duration
    # tracking.
    #
    # @return [Integer] Monotonic time in microseconds
    #   Range: Arbitrary starting point (typically system boot time), only
    #     meaningful for computing time differences
    #   Precision: 1 microsecond (1/1,000,000 second)
    #
    # @note This method is optimal for:
    #   - Measuring request/operation duration
    #   - Performance profiling and benchmarking
    #   - Timeout calculations
    #   - Rate limiting with time windows
    #   - Any scenario requiring reliable time differences

    #   - Timestamps that need to represent actual wall clock time
    #   - Values that need to be stored and compared across system reboots
    #   - Synchronization with external systems or databases
    #
    # @note Key differences from hnowµs:
    #   - hnowµs: CLOCK_REALTIME (wall clock) - for timestamps
    #   - now_in_μs: CLOCK_MONOTONIC (steady clock) - for durations
    #
    # @example Measuring operation duration
    #   start = Onetime.now_in_μs
    #   # ... perform operation ...
    #   duration = Onetime.now_in_μs - start  # microseconds elapsed
    #
    # @example Request timing in middleware
    #   start = Onetime.now_in_μs
    #   status, headers, body = @app.call(env)
    #   duration = Onetime.now_in_μs - start
