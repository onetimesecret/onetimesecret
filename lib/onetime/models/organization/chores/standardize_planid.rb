# Housekeeping chore: Normalize legacy organization.planid values to the
# current billing catalog.
#
# Three branches, all data-driven:
#
#   1. current ∈ CANONICAL_PLANIDS         → silent no-op
#   2. family  ∈ LEGACY_PLANID_MAP         → rewrite, log :info "Normalizing"
#   3. otherwise                           → log :info "Skipping unknown",
#                                            leave value alone
#
# `family` is `current` with any trailing legacy interval suffix removed
# (e.g. `_monthly`, `_v1_yearly`). This collapses interval-suffixed variants
# onto their base family without enumerating every permutation.
#
# Identity preservation: `'identity'` is intentionally kept as canonical.
# Pro-bono customers carry `customer.planid='identity'` and the
# `migrations migrate-probono-accounts` command (which operates on
# `customer.planid`, not `organization.planid`) is the authoritative path
# for those accounts. This chore deliberately does not touch them.
#
# Run via HousekeepingJob:
#   HousekeepingJob.perform('Onetime::Organization', :standardize_planid)
