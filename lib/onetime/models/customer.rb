module Onetime
  # Customer
  #
  # IMPORTANT API CHANGES:
  # Previously, anonymous users were identified by custid='anon'.
  # Now we use user_type='anonymous' as the primary indicator.
  #
  # USAGE:
  # - Authenticated: Customer.create!(custid, email)
  # - Anonymous: Customer.anonymous
  # - Explicit: Customer.new(custid: 'email', user_type: 'authenticated')
  #
  # AVOID: Customer.new('email@example.com') - creates anonymous user with email
  #
  # STATES:
  # - anonymous?: user_type == 'anonymous' || custid == 'anon'
  # - verified?: authenticated + verified == 'true'
  # - active?: verified + role == 'customer'
  # - pending?: authenticated + !verified + role == 'customer'
  #
  # The init method sets user_type: 'anonymous' by default to maintain
  # backwards compatibility, but business logic should use the explicit
  # factory methods above to avoid state inconsistencies.
